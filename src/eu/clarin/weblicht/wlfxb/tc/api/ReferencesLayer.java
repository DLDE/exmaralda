/**
 * The <tt>ReferencesLayer</tt> layer represents annotations on tokens, or 
 * sequences of tokens, that refer to the same entities. The layer consists of a
 * list of entity elements. Each entity element consists of all the mentions 
 * (reference elements) that refer to this entity. Each reference element 
 * enumerates token identifiers, pointing to a sequence of tokens that 
 * represents this reference. Optionally, the minimum sequence of tokens of the 
 * reference can be specified (e.g. when reference is a long noun phrase, 
 * minimum representation is the head of the phrase). Linguistic type of the 
 * reference (pronoun/nominal/name/demonstrative/zero pronoun, other/finer 
 * distinctions are possible) type can be specified. Relation to another 
 * reference (to target reference) can be specified as well (anaphoric, 
 * cataphoric, coreferential, etc.). Additionally, an external identifier of the
 * entity can be provided (url of a Wikipedia article for the entity, id of the
 * entity in a database, etc.) References layer has optional attributes to
 * specify type tagset for the case when linguistic types of references are 
 * specified, relation tagset for the case relations between references are 
 * specified, name of external reference source in case external references of 
 * entities are provided.
