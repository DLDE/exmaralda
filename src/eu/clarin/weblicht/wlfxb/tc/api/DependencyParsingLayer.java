/**
 * The <tt>DependencyParsingLayer</tt> annotates dependency relations between

 * well as a reference to a token, or sequence of tokens, that is in the 
 * governor role in the given relation. Optionally, the function of the 
 * dependent-governor relation is specified. In some cases, such as in the case 
 * of root dependency, the governor can be omitted. Additionally, the dependency 
 * layer specifies: a tagset for dependency function tags, whether empty tokens
 * can be inserted into the dependency parse, whether a dependent can have more 
 * than one governor in the parse.
